          Modular homes are modern residential buildings consisting of prefabricated modules assembled on-site. Each
          module typically contains a portion of living space and includes necessary systems such as electricity, water
          supply, heating, etc. This construction method allows for quick and efficient creation of homes
          of various sizes and configurations

          Durability - modules are made of high-quality materials, ensuring a long service life. Customization - clients
          can choose various parameters for their future home, including size, layout, and design. Fast installation -
          thanks to preassembly and module assembly at the factory, installation time on-site is reduced to several
          weeks
